<p>2.1.&nbsp;This License is applicable to companies and individuals registered in all countries except the Russian
	Federation, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Armenia and Ukraine. The companies
	and individuals registered in the countries listed in this clause must accept the License Agreement published at <a
			href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/license">https://www.cuba-platform.ru/license</a>.</p>

<p>2.2. In consideration of the Licensee agreeing to (and on the condition that the Licensee does throughout the term of
	this Licence) abide by the terms of this Licence, Haulmont grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable
	licence (for the full period of the copyright in the Software commencing on and including the Commencement Date) to
	use the Software and the Documentation in any country of the world on the terms of this Licence.</p>

<p>2.3. The Licensee may:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2.3.1. download the Software from the <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.com/en"
																	   target="_blank">www.cuba-platform.com</a> website

	Sessions. In this clause, public access means the case when an Application is hosted by the Licensee, but any third
	party person or organization can get access to it, either for a fee or free of charge. For the avoidance of doubt,
	providing public access to an Application hosted by the Licensee does not qualify as supplying Derived Software to
	third parties;</p>

	only with a Licence File (as may be appropriate to the Licensee's use of the Derived Software) obtained from

	Licence File must be either a Free Licence File or must:</p>

	Date Range;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2.4.4. save as permitted by clauses 2.3.4, 2.3.5 or 2.5, hand over or disclose to any

	representations, assurances or other terms which might have effect between the parties or be implied or incorporated
	into this Licence or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded to
	the fullest extent permitted by law, including any implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory
	quality, fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care.</p>

	Intellectual Property Rights of any third party.</p>

<p>6.3. Subject to clause 6.6, Haulmont undertakes at its own expense to provide legal representation for the Licensee
	in respect of any claim or action brought against the Licensee alleging that the possession or use of the Software
	(or any part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Licence infringes the Intellectual Property Rights in the
	United Kingdom of a third party ("<strong>Claim</strong>") and shall be responsible for paying any legal costs
	and/or damages awarded by an English court against the Licensee in favour of the claimant in respect of the Claim.
	For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 6 shall not apply where the Claim in question is attributable to possession
	or use of the Software (or any part thereof) by the Licensee other than in accordance with the terms of this
	Licence, nor use of the Software in combination with any hardware or software not supplied or specified by Haulmont
	if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software not so combined, nor use of a non-current
	release of the Software.</p>

<p>6.4. Subject to clause 6.6, if any third party makes a Claim, or notifies an intention to make a Claim against the

	the Claim in reasonable detail;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.4.2. not making any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the
	Claim without the prior written consent of Haulmont (at Haulmont's absolute discretion);</p>

	settlement thereof; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.4.4. giving Haulmont all assistance that it may reasonably require in the conduct of any
	Claims, including giving Haulmont and its professional advisers access to its premises and its officers, directors,
	employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records within
	the power or control of the Licensee, so as to enable Haulmont and its professional advisers to examine them and to
	take copies (at Haulmont's expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim.</p>

<p>6.5. Subject to clause 6.6, if any Claim is made, or in Haulmont's reasonable opinion is likely to be made, against
	the Licensee, Haulmont may at its absolute discretion and expense:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.1. procure for the Licensee the right to continue to use the Software (or any part
	thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Licence;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.2. modify the Software so that it ceases to be infringing;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.3. replace the Software with non-infringing software; or</p>

	thereof as it would have had under this Licence had the references to the date of this Licence been references to
	the date on which such modification or replacement was made.</p>

<p>6.6. Clauses 6.3 to 6.5 (inclusive) shall only apply if the total Licence Fees paid to Haulmont by the Licensee for
	its use of the Software under this agreement in the 60 months immediately prior to the date that the Licensee is
	first notified of the Claim exceed GBP £10,000 (ten thousand pounds sterling).</p>

<p>6.7. This clause 6 constitutes the Licensee's exclusive remedy and Haulmont's only liability in respect of Claims.
	For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 6 is subject to the provisions of clause 5.</p>

<p><strong>7. Third party software</strong></p>

<p>7.1. The Software uses and is distributed with third party software libraries ("<strong>Third Party
	Libraries</strong>"). Haulmont is permitted to sub-licence the Third Party Libraries to the Licensee, provided that
	the Licensee complies with the terms on which the Third Party Libraries are licenced to Haulmont ("<strong>Third
		Party Terms</strong>"). Further information on Third Party Libraries used in the latest versions of the Software
	and Third Party Terms is provided at <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.com/documentation" target="_blank">www.cuba-platform.com/documentation</a>.
	The Licensee acknowledges and accepts that its use of the Software (including the supply of Derived Software to
	third parties) is subject to the Third Party Terms. The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Haulmont shall have no
	liability whatsoever for any unauthorised, illegal or unlawful use of any Third Party Libraries by the Licensee.</p>

<p>7.2. All Forks used in and distributed with the Software are sub-licensed to the Licensee on the same Third Party
	Terms as the corresponding Third Party Library modified by the relevant Forks.</p>

<p>8.3. Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either party may terminate this Licence with

	notified in writing to do so;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">8.3.2. the other party repeatedly breaches the terms of this Licence in such a manner as

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">8.6.2. the Licensee shall cease all activities authorised by this Licence;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">8.6.3. the Licensee shall immediately destroy or return to Haulmont (at its option) all

<p>No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Licence or by law shall constitute
	a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any
	other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further
	exercise of that or any other right or remedy.</p>

	and shall have no right or remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made

	deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not

	Licence.</p>

	into any commitments for or on behalf of any other party.</p>

<p>15.2. Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.</p>

<p><strong>16. Force majeure</strong></p>

<p>Neither party shall be in breach of this Licence nor liable for delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of
	its obligations under this Licence if such delay or failure result from events, circumstances or causes beyond its
	reasonable control. In such circumstances the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the
	period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed or failed to be performed. If the period of delay
	or non-performance continues for one month, either party may terminate this Licence by giving 14 days' written
	notice to the other party.</p>
